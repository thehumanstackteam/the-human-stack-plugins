# JTBD Synthesis

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Aggregate and synthesize insights across multiple JTBD call analyses stored in `Jobs To Be Done/`. Surfaces patterns invisible in any single call.

## Workspace Structure

Analyses are organized into top-level folders:

```
Jobs To Be Done/
├── Diagnostic & Managed Success/
│   ├── Calls & Meetings/[Company]/     ← source analyses
│   └── Synthesis/                       ← synthesis reports saved here
├── Project Evident Coaching/
│   ├── Calls & Meetings/[Company]/
│   └── Synthesis/
├── Webinars & Speaking/
│   ├── Calls & Meetings/[Company]/
│   └── Synthesis/
└── Jobs 2B Done - Plugin & Skills/
    └── JTBD-Synthesis-Prompt.md         ← synthesis methodology
```

**Always scan for current folders** — new ones may be added at any time.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Scope the Synthesis

Ask the user what they want to synthesize. Options:

- **All calls** — Read every analysis across all folders
- **Single folder** — All calls within one folder (e.g., `Diagnostic & Managed Success`)
- **Single company** — All calls for one company across folders (useful for JTBD evolution tracking)
- **Date range** — Filter by call date across all folders
- **Engagement stage** — Filter by stage (Pre-sale, Discovery, Active Client, Alumni)
- **Custom** — Any combination of filters

### 2. Load Source Files

1. **Read the synthesis prompt** from: `Jobs To Be Done/Jobs 2B Done - Plugin & Skills/JTBD-Synthesis-Prompt.md`
2. List all `Calls & Meetings/` subdirectories across folders
3. Apply the user's filter (folder, company, date, stage, or all)
4. Read each matching `.md` analysis file
5. Also load any existing synthesis reports from `Synthesis/` folders for context on established findings

**Extract from each analysis:**
- Company name (from folder)
- Call date (from filename)
- Parent folder (from path)
- Participant names and roles
- Primary JTBD
- Functional / Emotional / Social jobs
- Switch triggers
- Obstacles & anxieties
- Messaging gold quotes
- Audience segment / persona
- IP & framework applications
- Product/offering fit
- Pattern recognition flags (known and emerging)
- Confidence scores

### 3. Run Cross-Call Analysis

Follow the synthesis methodology in `JTBD-Synthesis-Prompt.md`. Key synthesis dimensions:

**A. Recurring Functional Jobs** — Clustered by theme, ranked by frequency and confidence

**B. Recurring Emotional Jobs** — Fears/anxieties and aspirations, ranked by intensity

**C. Recurring Social Jobs** — Who they're performing for (board, peers, staff, funders)

**D. Switch Trigger Patterns** — What pushes orgs to act, with sector/size correlations

**E. Obstacle & Anxiety Clusters** — Grouped by theme, evolution over time

**F. Language & Messaging Patterns** — Cross-call quotes, recurring metaphors, vocabulary gaps

**G. Audience Segment Convergence** — Persona clusters, archetype validation (Lone Wolf Champion, Mission-Driven Skeptic Coalition)

**H. IP & Framework Application** — Framework usage, gaps, emerging concepts worth naming

**I. Product/Offering Fit** — Offering-to-job mapping, entry point patterns, capability gaps

**J. JTBD Evolution** — For single-company or longitudinal: how jobs shift across calls

**K. Evidence Level Assessment** — N=1 hypothesis, N=2 pattern, N=3+ finding (per synthesis prompt rules)

### 4. Determine Save Location

**Ask the user** which folder's `Synthesis/` to save in, unless:
- The synthesis is scoped to a single folder → save in that folder's `Synthesis/`
- The synthesis is cross-folder ("all calls") → ask user, or default to root level

If the `Synthesis/` subfolder doesn't exist in the target folder, create it.

**File naming:** `[YYYY-MM-DD] - JTBD Synthesis - [scope description].md`
- Examples:
  - `2026-02-08 - JTBD Synthesis - All Calls.md`
  - `2026-02-08 - JTBD Synthesis - Episcopal Relief & Development.md`
  - `2026-02-08 - JTBD Synthesis - Pre-sale Calls Q3 2025.md`

### 5. Generate Synthesis Report

**Output structure:**

```markdown
# JTBD Synthesis: [Scope]
**Generated**: [Date]
**Calls analyzed**: [Count]
**Companies**: [List]
**Folders**: [List of folders included]
**Date range**: [Earliest] to [Latest]

```

**Save to**: `Jobs To Be Done/[Folder]/Synthesis/[filename].md`

**Always show the user the synthesis before saving** so they can review.

### 6. Cross-Reference with ~~CRM (Optional)

If ~~CRM is connected, enrich the synthesis:
- Deal status for each company — which JTBD patterns correlate with won deals?
- Pipeline stage data — do certain jobs predict where deals stall?
- Contact roles — do certain personas convert at higher rates?

## Important Notes

- Read the `JTBD-Synthesis-Prompt.md` fresh each time — it contains established findings, archetypes, and meta-jobs that evolve.
- Distinguish evidence levels: N=1 hypothesis, N=2 pattern, N=3+ finding.
- Synthesis, not summary — identify what's invisible at the individual call level.
- When quoting across calls, always cite which call/company the quote came from.
- This synthesis is most valuable with 3+ calls. With fewer, flag conclusions as preliminary.
